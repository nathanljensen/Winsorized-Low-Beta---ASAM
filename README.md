# Winsorized-Low-Beta---ASAM
Repo that contains the code that informed the portfolio of stocks selected in the year of 2022 for the Anderson Student Asset Management capstone.

My team devised an investment strategy and created a model to inform a portoflio of stocks. We used real money (~300k) and had a goal of beating a benchmark fund. I served as the primary programmer for the team. See (https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/degrees/full-time-mba/academics/capstone-project/anderson-student-asset-management-asam/portfolios) under Group 4 for more details.
