# Winsorized-Low-Beta---ASAM
Repo that contains the code that informed the portfolio of stocks selected in the year of 2022 for the Anderson Student Asset Management capstone.

My team devised an investment strategy and created a model to inform a portoflio of stocks. We used real money (~300k) and had a goal of beating a benchmark fund. I served as the primary programmer for the team. See (https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/degrees/full-time-mba/academics/capstone-project/anderson-student-asset-management-asam/portfolios) under Group 4 for more details.

For the fund report please see "ASAM 2022 Annual Report.pdf" starting on page 28 (aka Low Beta).

Note that not all data input files could be uploaded to repo due to size constrains, but similar files can be downloaded from WRDS. The non-uploaded files are as follows:
